# Goal

This is a simple POC to demostrate that we can use cache along with POST. The first version only supports Varnish as cache server, but feel free to add other technology to demostrate how it could work using that technology.

# How to use it

```bash
docker-compose build
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```

```bash
chmod a+x requests.sh
./requests.sh
```
